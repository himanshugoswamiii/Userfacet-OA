## USAGE
- You can create multiple surveys of 20 questions
- 

1. Create a survey (We need atleast 1 survey to work with)

Example input :

```json
{
  "name": "survey-1",
  "questions" : [
      "question 1",
      "question 2",
      "question 3",
      "question 4",
      "question 5",
      "question 6",
      "question 7",
      "question 8",
      "question 9",
      "question 10",
      "question 11",
      "question 12",
      "question 13",
      "question 14",
      "question 15",
      "question 16",
      "question 17",
      "question 18",
      "question 10",
      "question 20"
    ]
}


```

2. Add responses for the available surveys

Here you'll add the response user by user

```json
{
  "candidate_name": "Himanshu",
  "response": [
    0,
    null,
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
    6
  ]
}
```

> `null` represents no response for that question
